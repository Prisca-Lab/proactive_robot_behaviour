# Computational Approach for Proactive Robot Behaviour
In order to discover how robots can be endowed with proactive behaviour, we devised a learning pipeline consisting of three main phases: 
1) **Learning to be Proactive**, in which we request participants to play alone with the possibility of asking for assistance when necessary; 
2) **Learning to be Proactive with Confidence**, in which participants play with the assistance of a proactive virtual-screen robot trained with the data collected in the previous phase; 
3) **Proactive Robot with Confidence**, in which participants play with the Furhat robot endowed with the model fine-tuned in the second phase. 

The aim is to learn an _Influence Diagram_ (ID) that best fits a given player's profile. Towards this purpose, we designed different experimental studies in which participants are requested to play a sequential memory game with a peer (either a virtual robot or a real one), which time by time can help and support them proactively. We profiled participants by using the *Demographic Game Design model* (DGD) to avoid a one-size-fits-all policy for all ones. In the end, we assess how proactivity is perceived by the participants and whether and to what extent it has an impact on their game performance.
